It should have been no problem – I mean, we  \\ndo have houses in Germany. It’s basically the same process, right?\\nRight – but where I come from, we measure in meters and kilometers.  \\nSo, you can just imagine my confusion when my realtor started describ -\\ning lot sizes in quarter-acre, half-acre, etc. What the heck? How big is an  \\nacre?\\nOf course, I didn’t want to ask – no one likes to seem ignorant – but I  \\nlooked it up. An acre is 43,560 square feet. Great. That didn’t really help  \\nme. Now I knew the exact measurements, but I still couldn’t picture the  \\nexact size of “an acre” in my head. I had no frame of reference.\\nBut, I have it now. A friend of mine told me that an acre is about the size  \\nof an American football field without the end zones.\\nIX\"),\n",

Starting Your Own Company or Internet Business\\n2.) Investing in Real Estate\\n3.) Day Trading\\nOption 1: Starting Your Own Company or Internet Business\\nHaving your own company means that you’ll have to find or create a  \\nproduct, market the product, sell the product, deliver the product to your  \\ncustomers, and collect the payments.\\nThese days, there are many “Internet Marketing Gurus” trying to sell you  \\non the idea that you can automate everything, which will allow you to  \\nsleep late, do nothing, and cash very fat checks on a regular basis. We  \\nboth know that this is a dream, nothing more.\\nYou can automate the routine, sure, but not the exceptions. And believe  \\nme: there are always exceptions when dealing with people – your cus -\\ntomers. Plus, as long as you have computers involved, you need to keep  \\nMurphy’s Law in mind: \"Whatever can go wrong, WILL go wrong.” \\nNothing could be truer!\\nEven if you could automate most of the delivery, you still have to find or  \\ncreate a product, set up a website, write salescopy, put the automation in  \\nplace, and generate traffic. And since the Internet is evolving so quickly,  \\nyou will constantly have to update your website and traffic generation  \\nmethods.\\nOkay, so what if you skipped the Internet part? If you have a “physical”  \\nbusiness, the headache might be even bigger: employees, vendors, law -\\nyers,  competitors,  invoices,  customers,  production  problems,  office  \\nspace, equipment, etc. I’ve known a number of small business owners  \\nwho have simply given up and gotten a regular 9-5 job. Sometimes the  \\nreward just isn’t worth the stressful lifestyle.\\nXII'),\n",

But  \\nwith the market slowing down and the current credit crunch, it’s not that  \\neasy anymore. Most lenders these days require a down payment of 10-\\n20% for investment properties, so you also need substantial capital to  \\neven get into the business.\\nAnother problem is the cost of a transaction. Whenever you buy or sell a  \\nhouse, you will most likely have to pay a Realtor’s commission and face  \\nclosing costs. Because of these factors, it’s not easy to quickly buy and  \\nsell houses. A transaction can last several days or several weeks. And on  \\ntop of that, you always have the possibility of problems with renters (if  \\nyou are renting out), or with contractors (if you are “fixin’ and flippin’”)  \\nor with legal issues if you use those “creative techniques” that some of  \\nthe late night infomercials are promoting. It basically boils down to one  \\nbig pain in the neck!\\nYou need an appraisal, too, and you might have to argue with the ap -\\npraiser about the value of the house; you need a home inspection and  \\nmight be surprised when you learn of all the things that need to be fixed  \\nbefore you can sell; and, last but not least, your buyer might have to ob -\\ntain a mortgage. As you know, the mortgage industry has really become  \\n“interesting” in 2007 (to say the least), and buyers that were pre-ap -\\nproved and pre-qualified might learn the day before closing that they  \\nwon’t receive the promised loan. And all of these problems are just the  \\ntip of the iceberg. When it comes to hassle and problems, real estate in -\\nvesting is a flip of the coin, at best.\\nSo, what’s left?\\nXIII'),\n",

Here are ten rea -\\nsons why:\\n1.) It’s the total “equal opportunity” job\\nYour race doesn’t matter. Your skin color doesn’t matter.  \\nYour education doesn’t matter, whether you’re a Ph.D. or a  \\ncollege  drop-out.  Your  sex  doesn’t  matter.  Your  origin  \\ndoesn’t matter. Your age doesn’t matter. Your background  \\nand history don’t matter. Even if you’ve been in jail for  \\nyears, you could still make money with trading. Your lan -\\nguage doesn’t matter. Your looks don’t matter. And your so -\\ncial status doesn’t  matter,  as long  as  you  have  sufficient  \\nfunds to trade.\\n2.) No employees to hire\\nYou don’t have to hire any employees, which means you  \\ndon’t have to worry about job interviews, payroll, employee  \\nevaluations, holidays, sick days, or employee performance.  \\nYour only “team member” is your broker, and if he doesn’t  \\nperform, there are 10 others waiting in line for your busi ness.\\n3.) No inventory, office space, or other equipment (besides  \\nyour phone and your computer)\\nYou don’t have to buy or rent expensive office space, and  \\nyou  don’t have to  stock  any  products, which  means  you  \\ndon’t have to worry about expiration dates, damaged goods,  \\nshipping, handling, insurance, or displays and promotions of  \\ngoods.\\n4.) No vendors, no customers, no invoices, and no accounts  \\nreceivable\\nYou won’t have to deal with any face-to-face contact. You  \\ndon’t need any vendors, you don’t need to satisfy any cus -\\ntomers, you don’t need to provide any customer support, and  \\nXIV'),\n",

The time required is minimal\\nWhether you have a regular job or run your own business,  \\nthe chances are that you’re working at least 40 hours per  \\nweek. With day trading, you can trade either part-time or  \\nfull-time. You can start trading for as little as one hour per  \\nweek, or you can go for the maximum of 2 hours per day. \\nIt’s your choice.\\n6.) Low capital requirement\\nYou don’t need a lot of money to get started. This is not like  \\nbuying property, for example, where you’re on the hook for a  \\nmonthly  mortgage  and  other  cash-draining  expenses.  In  \\ntrading, you can start with as little as $1,000! (We’ll talk  \\nabout how a little later.)\\n7.) Returns are almost instantaneous\\nI\\'m talking \"fast cash\" in the sense that trading allows for  \\nquick liquidation. You can convert trades for cash within  \\nseconds. Where else in the world can you make money this  \\nfast and comfortably? You can buy and sell and buy again in  \\nminutes. You don’t have to wait to see your profits. Try this  \\nwith real estate or physical goods, where you might have to  \\nwait weeks, or even months.\\n8.) Low transaction cost\\nYou pay less than $10 per transaction in trading. Compare  \\nthat to real estate transactions, in which you have to pay sev -\\neral thousand dollars in closing costs, not to mention a 3-6%  \\ncommission to your realtor.\\nXV'),\n",

Does that sound reasonable?\\nLet’s break it down: $150,000 per year would be $12,500 per month, or,  \\nif you prefer, $3,000 per week. This is assuming that you are taking two  \\nweeks of vacation per year.\\nIMPORTANT: Don’t set daily targets when you trade. In order to make  \\nmoney, two conditions have to be met:\\n1.) YOU have to be ready to trade.\\n2.) THE MARKET must be ready to be traded.\\nThere will be days when YOU are not at your best (sickness, emotional  \\nstress, no time because of an emergency, etc.), and there will be days  \\nwhen the market is not ready to be traded (e.g. holidays, including the  \\ndays before and after holidays, days before a major news release, like the  \\nFederal announcement regarding interest rates or the unemployment re -\\nport, etc.).\\n9'),\n",

It’s the same  \\nbetween the rest of the days after Christmas and through New Year’s Day  \\nin 2008. Though the markets were open, the volume was very thin.  \\nDuring these types of low-volume days, markets can be easily manipu -\\nlated and might behave very erratic, so it would be best to stay away  \\nfrom trading.\\nAnd that’s why you shouldn’t set daily goals in your trading: those goals  \\nwill force you to trade on days when both of the previously mentioned  \\nconditions – you AND the market being ready – are NOT met.\\nIt’s important to start small and set a weekly goal for only ONE contract,  \\nor 100 shares. This goal should be LOW, very low, so that it is easy for  \\nyou to reach it. Think about high-jumping: you train with a bar that’s  \\nonly three feet high. It’s easy to jump.

Put it at a level that you can manage every single time. You can al -\\nways increase it at a later date, once you’ve proven that you can meet  \\nyour goal consistently.\\nExample:\\nIn the first four weeks of your trading, you might set your weekly target  \\nat $100 per contract. This might sound too easy for you, but keep in mind  \\nthat 90% of traders lose money in the markets. When you can make $100  \\nper contract consistently, you can start “raising the bar.” Try $150 per  \\ncontract per week. Raise the bar again and again, but make sure that  \\nyou’re still comfortable in achieving your goals.\\nWhen day trading futures, options, or forex, you can use leverage and  \\ntrade multiple contracts on a rather small account. If you’re thinking  \\nabout trading the futures market, then you can easily find a broker who  \\nwill enable you to trade one contract of almost any futures instrument  \\nthat’s out there – E-mini S&P, E-mini Russell, currency futures, interest  \\nrates, commodities, etc. – on a $2,000 account.\\nAfter awhile, you might raise the bar to $300 per contract per week. So,  \\nif you want to make $3,000 per week, then you need to trade ten con -\\ntracts. The same applies to stock trading: if you can make $300 per week  \\ntrading 100 shares, then you need to trade 1,000 shares in order to make  \\n$3,000 per week.\\nAt this point, you might not have enough money in your trading account  \\nto trade in these increments, but don’t worry – we’ll get there.\\nThe key element to trading success is having a sound trading strategy  \\nthat produces consistent profits. If you can make money day trading one  \\ncontract or 100 shares of stock, then you can make money day trading  \\nten contracts or 1,000 shares of stock.\\nIdeally, to achieve your weekly goal, you’ll have a high average profit  \\nper trade.

If that’s something you have trouble accepting, then  \\nyou shouldn’t be trading. However, there’s a huge difference between  \\nlosing big on a regular basis and losing small in a controlled trading plan.  \\nYou already know that you should keep your losses small; the key is to  \\nkeep them smaller that your average wins.\\nLet’s go back to the scenario I mentioned before: you have a trading  \\nstrategy that produces $300 in profits for every win and costs you $200  \\nfor every loss. Now, if your weekly goal is $300, and if your first trade  \\nwas a loss of $200, then you need to make two winning trades to achieve  \\nyour weekly profit goal.\\nLet me take this a little farther and actually break it down for you: you’ve  \\nlost $200 on your one losing trade, and then you make $600 on your two \\nwinning trades ($300 each). Your net profit = $400. Goal achieved. Now,  \\nSTOP TRADING. Otherwise, you’ll end up giving back the money you  \\njust made to the markets. Lock in your profits!\\nOf course, you’re not always guaranteed a week with only one loss. Let’s  \\nlook at a week that starts off with three losses. With three losses, you are  \\nnow down $600 ($200 each). So you would need to have three wins that  \\nresult in $900 ($300 each). Subtract the $600 you lost on the losing  \\ntrades from the $900 you won on the winning trades, and your resulting  \\nnet profit is $300. Goal achieved.

This  \\nisn’t true! To determine how much money you should trade, you must  \\nfirst determine how much you can actually afford to lose, and what your  \\nfinancial goals are.\\nLet’s begin by determining how much of your savings should remain in  \\nyour savings account. It’s important to keep three to six months of living  \\nexpenses in a readily accessible savings account, so set that money aside,  \\nand don’t trade it! You should never trade money that you may need  \\nimmediately. Unless you have funds from another source, such as a re -\\ncent inheritance, the remaining amount of money will probably be what  \\nyou currently have to trade with.\\nTake a good look at how much money you can currently afford to trade.  \\nYou don’t want other parts of your life to suffer when you tie your  \\nmoney up in a trade, so make sure to consider what these savings were  \\noriginally for.\\nNext, determine how much you can add to your trading activities in the  \\nfuture. If you are currently employed, you will continue to receive an  \\nincome, and you can plan to use a portion of that income to build your  \\ninvestment portfolio over time.\\nTwo more important things to remember:\\n\\ue12c As outlined above, certain types of investments require an initial  \\ndeposit amount to get started. This does not mean that you will  \\nbe risking the whole amount (see the chapter “Determining Your  \\nRisk Tolerance” on page 27).

An analyst literally analyzes the stock or futures market,  \\npredicting what it will or will not do, or how specific stocks or com -\\nmodities might perform. A broker is there to follow your instructions to  \\neither buy or sell, not to analyze the markets.\\nIn most cases, brokers earn their money from commissions on sales.  \\nWhen you instruct your broker to buy or sell, they earn a set percentage  \\nof the transaction. Many brokers charge a flat ‘per transaction’ fee.\\nThere  are  two  types  of  brokers:  full-service  brokers and  discount \\nbrokers.\\nFull-service brokers can usually offer more types of investments, may  \\nprovide you with investment advice, and are usually paid in commis -\\nsions.\\nDiscount brokers typically do not offer any advice or research; they just  \\ndo as you ask them to do, without all of the bells and whistles.\\nSo, the biggest decision you must make when it come to brokers is  \\nwhether you want a full-service broker or a discount broker.\\nIf you are new to investing, you may need to go with a full-service bro -\\nker in order to ensure that you are making wise investments. They can  \\noffer you the skills that you lack at this point. However, if you are al -\\nready knowledgeable about the market you want to trade, then all you  \\nreally need is a discount broker to make your trades for you.\\nSelecting the right broker can be a tedious battle for most novice traders.  \\nThere  are  more  than  a  hundred  online  brokers  today  and  additional  \\nchoices are becoming available all the time.\\nThe challenge lies with too many choices – it isn’t easy to choose which  \\nbroker is best for you amongst all of the many options out there.\\nThis section, though, is all about providing you with some necessary tips  \\nfor picking an ideal trading broker.\\n37'),\n",

Since the foreign exchange market is worth trillions  \\nof dollars, it offers lucrative opportunities for brokers to set up their firms  \\nonline. And since the foreign exchange market is decentralized, it can be  \\nhard to identify quality brokers amongst all of the unscrupulous brokers  \\nwith fraudulent practices.\\nYour chances of finding an honest and reliable forex trading broker will  \\ndramatically increase if you follow the guidelines below:\\n\\ue12c Always request references that you can actually speak with.\\n\\ue12c Do a check with the local regulatory agencies and make sure that  \\nthe forex trading broker is registered. For U.S.-based brokers,  \\nsee  if  they  are  registered  as  Futures  Commission  Merchants  \\n(FCM)  with  the  Commodity  Futures  Trading  Commission  \\n(CFTC), and registered with the National Futures Association  \\n(NFA).\\n\\ue12c Compare the account details, such as the minimum deposit re -\\nquired, leverage, spreads, and so on. Ask them specifically if  \\ncommissions are chargeable, lot fees, etc. This is to ensure that  \\nyou do not incur hidden costs. Some sneaky brokers will deliber -\\nately give you an impression that they are the cheapest to use,  \\nbut in actual fact, they’ll hit you where it hurts when it comes to  \\nhidden charges.\\n\\ue12c The trading platform needs to be user-friendly. Many traders,  \\nespecially  first-timers,  find  it  challenging  to  navigate  trading  \\nsoftware. Just making sense of the charts and currency prices can  \\nbe a challenge. So, if there are demo accounts, try them.\\nI’ve also included a list of questions for you to ask your broker in the  \\nappendices.\\nRemember, this broker or brokerage is going to be your teammate when  \\nit comes to making you a wealthy person. So be picky and be cautious.\\n38'),\n",

But you’ve also heard this warning  \\nseveral times: “Don’t trade with money that you can’t afford to lose.”  \\nYou might think that this is just the typical disclaimer that every profes -\\nsional in the trading industry has to use. But it’s not. It’s much more.\\nLet me give you an example:\\nA few weeks ago, I received an email from a trader who told me that his  \\nwife had given him a deadline: if he was not trading profitably within the  \\nnext four weeks, he would have to stop trading altogether and get a ‘real  \\njob.’\\nI’m not saying that this trader’s wife didn’t have ground to stand on, but,  \\nas you’ll learn in the third part of this book, there’s more to trading than  \\njust having a strategy. You might have heard that a trader’s two biggest  \\nenemies are fear and greed. This is very often the case. That’s why con -\\ntrolling your emotions is extremely important to your trading.\\nNow, imagine this trader’s situation for me. He MUST be profitable  \\nevery single week for the next four weeks. Do you think he will be cool  \\nand relaxed when he enters a trade? Do you think he will be in control of  \\nhis emotions? If he loses a few trades, do you think he’ll stick to his  \\ntrading strategy and plan?\\nOr do you think he’ll be afraid of losing money, which means having to  \\ngive up what he LOVES to do? It will probably be hard to stick to a plan  \\nor strategy if he’s getting hit with more and more losses. Don’t you think  \\nit’s pretty likely that he’ll start making bad decisions and begin, in es -\\nsence, to gamble his money in the markets, hoping for wins?\\nI can’t stress enough how important it is not to put too much pressure on  \\nyourself or your trading performance. And in order to keep the pressure  \\nto a minimum, you probably shouldn’t quit your day job just yet. Before  \\nbecoming a professional day trader, your trading must be consistent, and  \\nyour profits should be almost predictable. Give yourself some time to  \\nprove that you have what it takes to trade for a living.\\n39'),\n",

If you have $100,000 in your trading account and  \\nonly risk $100 per trade, you might think of your losses as ‘peanuts.’ \\nEven though we must learn to accept losses as a part of the business, we  \\nshould still never think of them as ‘peanuts!’ There is a balance. You  \\nhave to find it.\\nSo, in order to avoid situations like the afore-mentioned trader got him -\\nself into, fund your account appropriately – not too much and not too  \\nlittle. And be prepared for a period of time where you may not make a lot  \\nof money with it. As with everything, there is a learning process when it  \\ncomes to trading.\\nFor more information on the right amount of money to get started with,  \\nsee the chapter “How Much Money Do You Need to Get Started?” on  \\npage 23.\\nA Trading Strategy\\nLast, but definitely not least: you need a trading strategy.\\nYou can have the latest computer, six screens, a T1-Internet connection,  \\nthe best broker in the world, and a well-funded trading account, but none  \\nof these will produce trading profits for you.\\nNEVER start trading without a trading strategy.\\nIn the next part of this book, you’ll learn how to develop a profitable  \\ntrading strategy that works for you.\\n40'),\n",

If not, determine how much it will  \\ncost to upgrade your computer. You do not have to upgrade your  \\ncomputer – or buy a new one – now, but you should know the \\ncost if you’re getting ready to trade.\\n\\uf0fc Check your current Internet connection and determine the cost  \\nfor an upgrade if needed. Same as with the other trading ele -\\nments: there’s no need to upgrade now, but you’ll want to know  \\nthe cost once you start your trading business.\\n\\uf0fc Take a look at different charting software packages. Most of  \\nthem offer a free 30-day trial. Get familiar with the software and  \\nmake a decision based on the “ease of use” of the software, NOT  \\non the price. You’ll work with this software almost every day, so  \\nit’s important to choose one that fits YOU best. When you start  \\nyour trading career, you don’t want to spend a lot of time learn -\\ning the software. It should be intuitive and easy-to-use.\\n\\uf0fc Start calling  several  brokers to  obtain  quotes. The  brokerage  \\nbusiness is highly competitive, so you need to shop around for  \\nthe best commission. But, as outlined above: do NOT base your  \\ndecision purely on commissions. Your broker is your only team  \\nmember, and you want to have a team member who you trust and  \\nwho knows you. Try to find a “personal broker” who has a direct  \\nline and doesn’t “hide” in a call center. Ask him what he can  \\noffer you. After a few calls you will get the feeling of a “good” \\nbroker.\\n41'),\n",

You  have  a  variety  of  \\nchoices, not just stocks, options, and futures. In recent years,  \\nfinancial instruments like Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), Single Stock  \\nFutures (SSF), and the Foreign Exchange Market (forex) have become  \\navailable for the private investor.\\nW\\nIn addition, the existing financial instruments have been enhanced. Ex -\\nchanges started introducing electronic contracts and mini contracts of  \\npopular commodities like gold, silver, crude oil, natural gas, and grains.  \\nThese futures contracts have become very popular amongst day traders,  \\nand the volume of the mini and electronic contracts quickly surpassed the  \\nvolume of the pit-traded commodities.\\nThese days, you can basically trade ANYTHING.

Leverage\\nLeverage is the second key. With sound risk management in  \\nplace, highly leveraged markets allow us to place a small  \\namount of capital into the market and realize larger profit  \\npotentials. This will enable us to build up a small account  \\nquickly.\\n3.) Liquidity\\nThe third factor is liquidity. We’ll focus on liquid markets to  \\navoid problems caused by market manipulation and slippage.  \\nWhen trading a market, we want to ensure that we receive  \\nquick and accurate fills for our orders, and also that a large  \\norder placed by a market-maker or broker does not move the  \\nmarket in an erratic way.\\n4.) Volatility\\nThe fourth factor is volatility. You can make money in any  \\nmarket, as long as it’s moving. A market that’s just going  \\nsideways and doesn’t move in any direction is extremely dif -\\nficult to trade. It’s easier to trade a market that’s either going  \\nup or going down.\\nThroughout the course of this book, you’ll learn how to trade any market, \\nbut it certainly helps to know something about the market you’re trading.  \\nSo, we’ll include a brief description of markets and participants in the  \\nbeginning of each of the following sections.\\nTrading Stocks\\nThe stock market is a private or public market for the trading of company  \\nstock at an agreed price. Companies are given a value by investors. The  \\nvalue of the company is divided into many shares. These shares can be  \\nbought or sold (raising or lowering the value of the company).\\n46'),\n",

You’ll become a shareholder. So, the more  \\nshares you buy, the larger the portion of the company you own. If the  \\nvalue of the company rises, the value of your shares rises. If the value of  \\nthe company decreases, the value of your shares decreases.\\nWhen the company makes a profit, you may receive some of that profit  \\nin the form of dividends; the profit is shared amongst all the people who  \\nown the stock.\\nOwnership of shares is normally called equity.\\nThere are two main types of stocks –  preferred stock and  common \\nstock – and there are many advantages to owning preferred stock over  \\ncommon stock. Here are the main ones:\\n1. When you’re holding a preferred stock, then the dividend is paid  \\nto you before any dividends are paid to common stock holders.\\n \\n2. A preferred stock typically pays a  fixed dividend that does not \\nfluctuate, unlike the dividend of a common stock.\\n3. Owners of preferred stocks have a greater claim on the com -\\npany’s  assets.  For  example,  in  case  of  bankruptcy,  preferred  \\nstock holders are paid first, before common stock holders.\\n \\nHowever, as a day trader, you really don’t have to worry about the dif -\\nferent kinds of stocks or dividend yields, since you’re just holding a  \\nstock for a few minutes or hours.\\nAvoiding Stock Trading Scams\\nIf you have an email account, then you’ve probably received a great deal  \\nof emails with Free Stock Trading Tips.

And, if you ask your broker to buy this stock for you, you might  \\nend up paying 4-5 times more than normal in commissions.\\nThe stock picking service is now hoping that many of their subscribers  \\nwill start buying this stock. They typically say, \"It\\'s trading now at $0.02  \\nand it should go up to $0.12.” That would be a whopping 600% increase!  \\nSince stock traders are greedy by nature, many will probably start buying  \\nthis stock, and since there is a sudden demand, the stock prices will go up  \\n– initially.\\nBut, before the stock hits the predicted exit price, the stock picking ser -\\nvice starts selling (or dumping) the shares that they bought BEFORE  \\nthey recommended it to you.\\nSince they bought such a large amount of this stock, there\\'s suddenly an  \\nenormous supply available again, and prices start falling. More and more  \\ninvestors panic and sell their stocks, which drives the stock prices even  \\nfurther down.\\nAfter a massive sell-off, the stock is generally trading at the same level it  \\nwas BEFORE the stock picking service started recommending it. And, in  \\nsome cases, it’ll be  much lower, resulting in a loss for whoever was  \\ndrawn into the trap.

Capital Requirements\\nIn August and September of 2001, the NYSE and NASD  \\nestablished the Pattern Day Trading Rule. This rule dictates  \\nthat “if a trader executes four or more day trades within a  \\nfive-business-day period then he must maintain a minimum  \\nequity of $25,000 in his margin account at all times.” This  \\nmeans that you need at least $28,000-$30,000 if you want to  \\nday trade stocks, because you need a “cushion” if you ex -\\nperience losses.\\n2.) Leverage\\nWhen trading stocks, you can either open a “cash account”  \\nor a “margin account.” When you open a cash account, you  \\ncan buy or sell stock for exactly the amount you have in your  \\naccount – i.e. your leverage is 1:1.\\nWhen you open a margin account, you can trade stocks on  \\nmargin. Buying on margin is borrowing money from a bro-\\nker to purchase stock. You can think of it as a loan from your  \\nbrokerage. Margin trading allows you to buy more stock than  \\nyou'd be able to normally. An initial investment of at least  \\n$2,000  is  required  for  a  margin  account,  though  some  \\nbrokerages  require  more.  This  deposit  is  known  as  the  \\nminimum margin. Once the account is opened and opera-\\ntional, you can borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of a  \\nstock.\\nExample: Let's say that you deposit $10,000 in your margin \\naccount. Because you put up 50% of the purchase price, this  \\nmeans you have $20,000 worth of  buying power. Then, if \\nyou buy $5,000 worth of stock, you still have $15,000 in  \\nbuying power remaining. In this case your leverage is 1:2.\\n \\nIf you have developed a good relationship with your broker,  \\nhe might even allow you to borrow up to 80% of your initial  \\ndeposit, giving you a leverage of 1:8.\\n50\"),\n",

Around 900 stocks have an average  \\ndaily  volume  of  more  than  2,000,000  shares  traded,  and  \\nmore than 600 of them are traded with over 3,000,000 shares  \\nper day. If you focus on these stocks then you won’t have a  \\nproblem with market manipulation or slippage.\\n4.) Volatility\\nIn 2007, the average daily movement of the stocks in the  \\nDow Jones Index was between 1% and 2%, and many of  \\nthese stocks moved even more dramatically than that:\\n- Alcoa, Inc. (AA) moved between 2% and 5% per day\\n- American Intl. Group (AIG) moved between 2% and 8%  \\nper day\\n- American Express (AXP) moved between 2% and 6%  \\nper day\\nAnd that’s just naming the first three stocks of the Dow  \\nJones. Volatility has NOT been a problem in the stock mar -\\nkets, especially in 2007.\\nConclusion:\\nStock markets have good liquidity and volatility, but the initial capital  \\nrequirements are high ($25,000) and the maximum leverage is only 1:8.\\nTrading Forex\\nThis market may sound really complicated and frightening to tackle, but  \\ntrust me, it’s not. Just like any other type of trading, the basic rule in the  \\nforex market is that you have to buy when the market is going up and sell  \\nwhen the market is going down.\\n51'),\n",

Yet many traders shy away from futures trading because they’re  \\nnot familiar it.\\nThere’s a lot of misunderstanding when it comes to futures. People often  \\nthink that futures are extremely risky and difficult to trade. To some ex -\\ntent, that’s true. Thanks to high leverage, futures trading IS more risky  \\nthan stock trading.\\nHowever, futures trading – BECAUSE of the high leverage – also pro -\\nvides an excellent opportunity for the private trader.\\nSo what are futures? Futures contracts, simply called futures, are ex -\\nchange-traded derivatives. They are standardized contracts among buyers  \\nand sellers of commodities that specify the amount of a commodity, the  \\ngrade/quality, and the delivery location. These futures contracts are typi -\\ncally  traded  at  futures  exchanges,  like  the  Chicago  Board  of  Trade  \\n(CBOT), the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), the New York Mer -\\ncantile Exchange (NYMEX), and others.\\nBelow is a list of different types of futures contracts:\\n1.) Currencies  – The currency market is probably the best-known  \\ncommodity available, dealing in the British Pound, the American  \\nDollar, the European Euro, etc.\\n2.) Interest Rates – Interest rates are traded in two ways on this  \\nmarket:  long-term  interest  rates  are  represented  by  T-Bonds,  \\nwhile T-Bills are used for short-term interest rates.\\n3.) Energies – A variety of fuel commodities are traded on this mar -\\nket, including natural gas, heating oil, and crude oil futures.\\n59'),\n",

Food Sector – Sugar, coffee, and orange juice are just a few of  \\nthe regular goods traded in this sector.\\n5.) Metals – Commodities in  this  market are fairly  well-known,  \\nsuch as copper, gold, and silver.\\n6.) Agricultural – Futures in this market include wheat, corn, cof -\\nfee, and soybeans.\\nFutures are not borrowed like stock, and therefore initiating a short posi -\\ntion is just as common and easy as buying the futures.\\nA Little Bit of History\\nTrading on commodities  began in  early  18 th century Japan, with  the \\ntrading of rice and silk, and similarly in Holland, with tulip bulbs. Trad -\\ning in the U.S. began in the mid-19th century, when central grain markets  \\nwere established, and a marketplace was created for farmers to bring  \\ntheir commodities and sell them either for immediate delivery (called the  \\nspot or cash market), or for forward delivery. All contract trading began  \\nwith traditional commodities such as grains, meat, and livestock.\\nExchange trading these days has expanded to include metals, energy,  \\ncurrencies, currency indices, equities, equity indices, government interest  \\nrates, and also private interest rates. Contracts on the financial instru -\\nments  were  introduced  in  the  1970s  by  the  Chicago  Mercantile  Ex -\\nchange. These instruments became hugely successful and quickly over -\\ntook commodities futures in terms of trading volume and global accessi -\\nbility in the markets.\\nAll futures transactions in the United States are regulated by the Com -\\nmodities Future Trading Commissions (CFTC), an independent agency  \\nof the United States government. Each futures contract is characterized  \\nby a number of factors, including the nature of the underlying asset,  \\nwhen it must be delivered, the currency of the transaction, and at what  \\ndate the contract stops trading, as well as the tick size, or minimum legal  \\nchange in price.\\n60'),\n",

S&P 500 E-mini – This contract has all of the advantages of \\nthe S&P 500, but the cost of investment is much lower. It can  \\nbe traded electronically five days a week, almost 24 hours a  \\nday.  It’s  become  exceptionally  popular  in  the  futures  \\nmarkets.\\n2.) E-mini NASDAQ 100 – As with the S&P 500, this contract \\nis  electronically  traded;  it  tracks  the  movement  of  the  \\nNASDAQ 100. The margin amount required to trade is sig -\\nnificantly smaller than a standard contract, and since not all  \\ntraders have the funds to trade on the regular NASDAQ 100,  \\nthis E-mini is the perfect solution.\\n3.) Light Sweet Crude Oil – Oil futures are one of the most \\nwell-known  commodities  out  there.  Every  time  you  hear  \\nabout “the price of oil” in the paper or on the news, this is  \\nthe contract they’re talking about.\\n4.) Gold – The gold  futures contract is  also  popular. In  the  \\n1970s, the United States adopted the Gold Standard, creating  \\nan important place in the U.S. economy for gold. Since that  \\ntime,  the  gold  price  has  gone  through  regular,  dramatic  \\nchanges, and those changes are usually in the opposite di -\\nrection of the U.S. dollar. The gold futures contract follows  \\nthe changes in price per ounce of gold, and gold investments  \\nare frequently used in hedge funds.\\n5.) E-mini Euro FX – The E-mini Euro FX contract moves \\nwith the exchange rate between the European Euro and the  \\nU.S. dollar. As with the rest of the E-mini contracts, the  \\nmargin amounts required to trade the Euro FX are much  \\nlower than the regular contract amounts, which means that  \\nthis contract presents a fantastic opportunity for traders who  \\ndon’t have accounts large enough to trade the regular con -\\ntracts.\\nThe growing popularity of futures trading stems from the fact that only a  \\nrelatively small amount of money, known as initial margin, is required to  \\n61'),\n",

In order to make it affordable for pri vate \\ntraders, the SPY is divided by ten.\\nSo, we’re tracking the index, and the artificial stock is reduced by a fac -\\ntor of 10 – it’s trading at 156. If the SPX (the index) moves from 1560 to  \\n1570, then the SPY will move from 156 to 157.\\nIf you’re trading one share of SPY, you will make or lose one dollar.

Let’s calculate our return on that initial investment.\\nInstead of 0.6%, we are looking at 12.5%.

A futures contract is only valid for a  \\ncertain period of time. In the case of the E-mini S&P, a futures contract is  \\nvalid for 3 months. You might know this concept from options. Op tions \\nalso have an expiration date.\\nAfter the expiration date, a new futures contract starts trading and the old  \\ncontract expires. You might have heard horror stories that if you are  \\nholding a position and the futures contract expires, then you will have to  \\ntake delivery. So, according to these tales, if you are trading the grains –  \\ncorn, for example – and the contract expires, you will get the corn deliv -\\nered to your doorstep.\\nNo! That will not happen!\\nBasically, what will happen is this: before the futures contract expires,  \\nyour broker will get in contact with you and send you some information.  \\nIt will probably be something to the effect of, “Alright, in a couple of  \\ndays, this futures contract will expire. We should get rid of this position  \\nor roll it over.” Rollovers are when one contract expires, and the other  \\ncontract actually starts trading. This is something your broker will take  \\ncare of, so you don’t have to do anything on your end.\\nBelieve me, your broker doesn’t have any interest in you getting a physi -\\ncal delivery of corn, you don’t have any interest in getting a physical de -\\nlivery of corn, and it’s unlikely that anyone else has any interest in you  \\ngetting a physical delivery of corn either. So, don’t believe these horror  \\nstories.\\nJust be accessible to your broker, and you shouldn’t have any problems.  \\nMake sure that he has a number where you can be reached so that he can  \\ninform you of what’s going on.\\n67'),\n",

As you can see by the decimals in  \\nthe following graph, it’s trading at one-cent increments.\\nIn order to make futures trading a little easier, it’s been simplified even  \\nfurther. If you look at the following example, on the very right side, it’s  \\ntrading in quarter increments. If the E-mini S&P futures contract moves  \\nfrom 1560 to 1570, you’ll make or lose 500 dollars, depending on what  \\nkind of position you took. And if a 10 point move translates into a $500  \\ngain or loss, then a 1 point move is worth $50.\\n68'),\n",

So, you can see that it goes from 1550 to  \\n1550 and a quarter, 1550 and a half, 1550 and three quarters, and then up  \\nto 1551. If the minimum movement is a quarter, then every tick move  \\ntotals $12.50 (one quarter of $50). Very easy.

Well, it’s not really – all you need to know is  \\nthat when trading one futures contract with anywhere between 2,000 to  \\n4,000 dollars, you can make a return of 50 dollars per point. Keep in  \\nmind that you can also LOSE 50 dollars per point.\\n69'),\n",

Well, you could buy  \\n500 shares of the SPY stock. Or you could trade 20 futures contracts in  \\nthe ES. If you choose to trade the 20 futures contracts instead of the 500  \\nSPY stock shares, you’ll make 10,000 dollars! If you stick with the SPY  \\nshares, you’ll only make 500 dollars per 10-point move.\\nYou can see the difference. You get a much bigger leverage on your ac -\\ncount with futures trading, and a higher leverage is exactly what will  \\nhelp you grow your account (as long as you know what you’re doing).\\nMargins and Accounts\\nThere are two types of margins. The  initial margin (sometimes called \\nthe original margin) is the sum of money that the customer must deposit  \\n70'),\n",

Typically, the maintenance margin is smaller than the ini -\\ntial margin. Assume, for example, that the initial margin needed to buy or  \\nsell a particular futures contract is $2,000. A likely maintenance mar gin \\nrequirement might be $1,500.\\nAnother important thing to be aware of when dealing with margins is  \\nsomething called a  margin call.  If the margin drops below the margin  \\nmaintenance requirement established by the exchange listing the futures,  \\na margin call will be issued to bring the account back up to the required  \\nlevel. Basically, if you need to have $1,500 in your account for your open  \\ncontracts, and you don’t, then you can expect a margin call.\\nAnother difference in trading futures vs. stocks is that your account is  \\nsettled daily. Any day that profits accrue on your open positions, the  \\nprofits will be added to the balance in your margin account automati -\\ncally, not just when you close the position. When you are buying stocks,  \\nall the money that you make or lose will be either added or subtracted to  \\nyour account only when you close the position.\\nSo, when profits occur on your futures contracts, they will be added to  \\nthe balance of your margin account, and on any day losses accrue, the  \\nlosses will be deducted from the balance of your margin account.\\nKeep in mind, if the funds remaining in your margin account dip below  \\nthe maintenance margin requirement, your broker will require that you  \\ndeposit additional funds to bring the account back to the level of the re -\\nquired margin. Again, this is called a margin call.\\nDue to the low margin requirement, futures trading offers everyone an  \\nequal opportunity to make a fortune even with a small bank account.\\nPros and Cons of Futures Trading\\nFutures trading is amongst today’s most highly leveraged, potentially  \\nprofitable financial pursuits.

Therefore, it’s  \\ncrucial to your trading success that you diligently educate yourself in  \\nfutures trading, and trade only with a proven and solid trading strategy.\\nIf you’re new to futures trading, it can be especially difficult to decide  \\nWHICH contracts to actually trade. There are a lot of options! The best  \\napproach would probably be to start with the more popular commodities,  \\nuntil you have a better idea of which contracts most fit you and your  \\ntrading.\\nThe more you know about the basics of futures contracts and commodi -\\nties like this, the better your chances of trading success.\\nLet’s check futures trading against our criteria:\\n1.) Capital Requirements\\nIn order to trade a futures contract, you need to deposit an  \\ninitial investment into your futures trading account. As of the  \\nwriting of this book, most futures brokers require a mini -\\nmum of $5,000, though I have seen some brokers who are  \\nwilling to open an account with as little as $2,000.\\n2.) Leverage\\nThe leverage depends on the futures contract you’re trading  \\nand the contract value. Each contract requires an initial mar -\\ngin. Here are some examples for the most popular contracts  \\n(as of January 2008):\\nE-mini S&P – as low as $500 to trade a $75,000 contract\\n(Leverage 1:150)\\nE-mini NQ – as low as $500 to trade a $45,000 contract\\n(Leverage 1:90)\\nE-mini Gold – as low as $400 to trade a $27,000 contract\\n(Leverage 1:67.5)\\n72'),\n",

Liquidity\\nAgain, the liquidity depends on the futures contract you are  \\ntrading. Here are some numbers:\\nE-mini S&P: around 2,500,000 contracts/day\\nE-mini NQ: around 500,000 contracts/day\\nEuro Currency: around 200,000 contract/day\\nAs  you  can  see,  the  liquidity  varies,  and  therefore  you  \\nMUST check the volume of the futures market you are plan -\\nning to trade.\\n4.) Volatility\\nYou will find decent volatility in the futures markets. Like in  \\nthe forex markets, the high leverage will allow you to make  \\ndecent profits, even if the markets move just a few points.  \\nHere are some average daily moves:\\nE-mini S&P: between 1% and 3% per day\\nE-mini NQ: between 1% and 2.5% per day\\nE-mini Gold: between 1% and 2.5% per day\\nEuro Currency: between 0.5% and 1.5% per day\\nKeep  in  mind  that  these  moves  represent  approximately  \\n$500-$1,500 per day for each contract traded.\\nConclusion:\\nFutures markets can be very liquid, and the capital requirements are as  \\nlow as $2,000. The leverage is at least 1:50, and there’s decent volatility.\\nFutures markets are regulated and the spread is typically 1 tick (mini -\\nmum movement of the contract). Commissions are usually below $5 per  \\ntransaction. It’s no surprise that many day traders choose the futures  \\nmarket for their trading endeavors.\\nMake sure to check the volume and liquidity of the market you want to  \\ntrade, since there are huge differences between the markets.\\n73'),\n",

This is the difference  \\nbetween the price your option to buy ACME Holding, Inc. is set at – in  \\nthis case, $40 – and the price at which it is actually trading – $50.\\nThe reverse of this is a put (right to sell) option on an underlying asset.  \\nYou might feel that the market is overheated at the present time, and you  \\nwant to buy a put (right to sell) option.\\nThis will give the individual who bought the put option the right to sell  \\nthat option at an agreed upon price (strike price) on or before a specific  \\ndate (expiration date).\\n74'),\n",

Capital Requirements\\nLike stock trading, day trading stock options is subject to the  \\nPattern Day Trading Rule introduced by the NYSE and NASD in \\nAugust and September of 2001. This rule dictates that “if a trader  \\nexecutes four or more day trades within a five-business-day pe -\\nriod, then he must maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 in his  \\nmargin account at all times.” This means that you need at least  \\n$28,000-$30,000 if you want to day trade stock options, since  \\nyou need some money to buy options.\\n2.) Leverage\\nThe leverage depends on the option you choose. Without going  \\ninto too much detail, the price for the option depends on the time  \\nuntil expiration, the volatility of the underlying stock, and the  \\n“inner value” – i.e. if the option is already “in the money.”\\nNevertheless, you will notice that options offer high leverage.\\nExample: On December 27, 2007, IBM was trading at $110.16  \\nper share. If you wanted to buy 100 shares of IBM, then you  \\nwould have had to invest $11,016. The January Call, at a strike  \\nprice of $110, with 23 days left to expiration, only cost $3.30,  \\nand you could buy the right to purchase 100 IBM shares within  \\nthe next 23 days for only $330.\\nIn this example the leverage is approximately 1:30.\\n75'),\n",

Liquidity\\nOptions are typically not very liquid. Even if you trade options  \\non the Dow 30 stocks, you will notice that only a few thousand  \\noptions are traded per day. The reason for the low volume is the  \\nbroad choice of options: at any given time you have several  \\nstrike prices and multiple expiration dates available.\\nFortunately, option prices are NOT subject to market manipula -\\ntion since the value of an option is not determined by supply and  \\ndemand, but by a mathematical formula created by Black and  \\nScholes. But you do have a significant spread between the bid  \\nand the ask; in our IBM example, $0.10 or 3% of the option  \\nprice.\\n4.) Volatility\\nOptions that are traded “at the money” or “in the money” typi -\\ncally have a very high volatility. In our example, we chose an  \\nIBM “at the money” option with 23 days to expiration. The cur -\\nrent price was $3.30, and throughout the day, it was trading as  \\nhigh as $3.95. The previous day’s close was $4.30. Therefore,  \\nthe intraday volatility for this option was almost 20%. Consid -\\nering the previous day’s close, the overall volatility was close to  \\n30%.\\nConclusion\\nStock option trading offers similar advantages and disadvantages to stock  \\ntrading – you need a minimum of $25,000 in your trading account if you  \\nwant to day trade stock options. The leverage is higher than when you’re  \\ntrading stocks, but much lower than trading futures or forex. The liquid -\\nity is very low compared to the other markets, and the volatility is scary.\\nStock options are a fantastic instrument to trade when traded on daily or  \\nweekly charts. Day trading stock options is extremely risky and difficult,  \\nand not for the novice trader.\\n76'),\n",

Fundamental analysis looks at the CAUSE of market move -\\nment.\\nIn the following graph, you’ll find a snapshot of some “key statistics” for  \\nIBM. In addition to this company-specific data, you need to take the  \\noverall economic environment into consideration and start looking at  \\nvarious macroeconomic indicators, such as economic growth rates, inter -\\nest rates, inflation rates, and unemployment rates.\\nAs an example, interest rate hikes are seldom good news for stock mar -\\nkets. This is due to the fact that many investors will withdraw money  \\nfrom a country's stock market when there is a hike of interest rates,  \\ncausing the country's currency to weaken.\\nKnowing which effect prevails can be tricky.

When the Fed cut interest rates in January of 2008, the Dow  \\nJones Index jumped 200 points up.\\nIn addition, economic reports with key data like the PPI, CPI, PMI, GDP,  \\nand, recently, even housing statistics, have proven to have a significant  \\nimpact on the stock market. \\nConfused?\\nIf the abbreviations and the “key statistics” on the following graph don’t  \\nmake sense to you, or if they confuse you, then you are not alone.\\nFundamental analysis is not easy.

The  \\ndifference between the high and low on the charts is referred to as the  \\nRange.\\nThe fifth variable displayed on a chart is typically the volume (V), speci -\\nfying the number of shares, lots, or contracts traded during the time pe -\\nriod between the open of the market and the close.\\nPurely looking at these five points on the charts will not be enough to  \\nplan future trades. You need to look at them over a series of time in order  \\nto evaluate trends in the market.\\nDay traders use trading charts to watch the markets that they trade, and  \\ndecide when to make their trades. There are several different types of  \\ntrading charts, but they all show essentially the same trading information,  \\nsuch as the past and current prices.\\nIn the following section, we’ll discuss the three most popular types of  \\ntrading charts.\\nBar Charts\\nA bar chart, also known as a bar graph, is a chart with rectangular bars  \\nwhose lengths are proportional to the value they represent. Bar charts are  \\nused for comparing two or more values.\\nThe bar chart is one of the most common charting methods. A bar chart  \\nindicates a single bar that extends from the high to the low of the trading  \\nperiod it is meant to depict. In addition, the opening and closing price  \\nlevels could be displayed as small branches coming away from the main  \\nbar at the appropriate level. Closing prices are put on the right side of the  \\nbar. Opening prices are put on the left side.\\n87'),\n",

Open – The open is the first price traded during the bar, and is  \\nindicated by the horizontal foot on the left side of the bar.\\n2.) High – The high is the highest price traded during the bar, and is  \\nindicated by the top of the vertical bar.\\n3.) Low – The low is the lowest price traded during the bar, and is  \\nindicated by the bottom of the vertical bar.\\n88'),\n",

Close – The close is the last price traded during the bar, and is  \\nindicated by the horizontal foot on the right side of the bar.\\n5.) Direction – The direction of the bar is indicated by the locations  \\nof the opening and closing feet. If the closing foot is above the  \\nopening foot, the bar is an upward bar, and if the closing foot is  \\nbelow the opening foot, the bar is a downward bar. Sometimes a  \\ncharting software allows you to color these bars, in which case  \\nthe upward bars are typically colored green, and the downward  \\nbars are colored red.\\n6.) Range – The range of the bar is indicated by the locations of the  \\ntop and bottom of the bar. The range is calculated by subtracting  \\nthe low from the high (range = high - low).\\n89'),\n",

Homma  used  candlestick  charts  to  trade  rice  and  \\namassed a huge fortune in the markets. In fact, it was rumored that he  \\nnever had a single losing trade!\\nHuman psychology has never changed; it has remained constant over  \\ntime – candlestick charting is just as useful today as it was hundreds of  \\nyears ago.\\nEven though they may look a little complicated, there are some great rea -\\nsons to use candlestick charts. Here are the main ones:\\n\\ue12c Complement Other Technical Tools\\nYou can use candlestick charts as you would use the common bar  \\nchart, and you can combine them with traditional market in -\\ndicators. Candlestick charts are a great way to spot opportunities,  \\nfilter, and time trades with other indicators.\\n\\ue12c Spotting Trend Changes\\nBecause of the way candlestick charts are viewed, they can give  \\nyou visual warnings of market reversals much more clearly than  \\ntraditional bar charts. If you look at candlestick charting, the  \\nhuman psychology of the move literally jumps out of the page at  \\nyou.\\n\\ue12c Straightforward to Use\\nCandlestick charts use the same open, high, low, and close data  \\n90'),\n",

The different  \\ncandle names are also easy to remember.\\n\\ue12c Define Market Momentums\\nThe way the candlestick chart is drawn not only gives the direc -\\ntion of price, but also the momentum behind the move.\\nHow to Read Candlestick Charts\\nCandlestick charts consist of a wide vertical line, and a narrow vertical  \\nline. Each candlestick includes the open, high, low, and close of the time -\\nframe, the direction (upward or downward) of the timeframe, and the  \\nrange of the timeframe.\\nDuring live trading, you can read the candlestick chart like this:\\n1.) Open – The open is the first price traded during the candlestick,  \\nand is indicated by either the top or bottom of the wide vertical  \\nline (the bottom for an upward candlestick, and the top for a  \\ndownward candlestick).\\n2.) High – The high is the highest price traded during the candle -\\nstick, and is indicated by the top of the thin vertical bar (the wick  \\nof the candlestick).\\n3.) Low – The low is the lowest price traded during the candlestick,  \\nand is indicated by the bottom of the thin vertical bar (the upside  \\ndown wick of the candlestick).\\n4.) Close – The close is the last price traded during the candlestick,  \\nand is indicated by either the top or bottom of the wide vertical  \\nline (the top for an upward candlestick, and the bottom for a  \\ndownward candlestick).\\n5.)

Range – The range of the candlestick is indicated by the loca -\\ntions of the top and bottom of the thin vertical lines (the wicks).  \\nThe range is calculated by subtracting the low from the high  \\n(range = high - low).\\nThe candlestick chart body graphically illustrates the relationship behind  \\nthe open, high, low, and close, and this adds an extra visual edge, due to  \\nthe way they’re drawn.\\nThe candlestick has a wide part, called the \"real body.\" This real body  \\nrepresents the range between the open and close of that day\\'s trading.\\nIf the real body is filled with red, it means the close was lower than the  \\nopen.

The rest of  \\nthe time, prices will trade more or less in a sideways range. Our job is to  \\nrecognize trends early, as they emerge from non-trends, or as reversals of  \\nprior trends.\\nOur goal is to buy or sell our security early in these new trends, exiting  \\nthe trade profitably when the trend ends. This identification of trend,  \\nboth its beginning and end, is the most important task we have as traders.\\nA simple definition of trend is basically the general direction of price  \\nmovements. An uptrend is present when prices make a series of higher  \\nhighs and higher lows. A downtrend is present when prices make a series  \\nof lower highs and lower lows.\\nWhen prices move without such a discernible series, prices are said to be  \\ntrading sideways in a range, or trading trend-less. Once a trend is dis -\\ncernible, then trendlines can be drawn to define the lower limits of an  \\nuptrend or the upper limits of a downtrend.\\nIt is essential that trendlines be drawn correctly.

It points to equilibrium in supply and demand. Sideways trends  \\nfollow a horizontal direction, where the price stays relatively constant.  \\nTrading patterns are also used in order to set support and resistance lev -\\nels, which are very useful for the technical analysis of charts.\\nSupport & Resistance\\nSupport and resistance levels are points where a chart experiences recur -\\nring upward or downward pressure. A support level is usually the low  \\npoint in any chart pattern (hourly, weekly, or annually), whereas a resis -\\ntance level is the high or the peak point of the pattern.\\nThese points are identified as support and resistance when they show a  \\ntendency to reappear. It’s best to buy near support or sell near resistance  \\nlevels that are unlikely to be broken. Once these levels are broken, they  \\ninvariably reverse their roles. Previous support becomes resistance and  \\nprevious resistance becomes support.\\nSupport and resistance levels are very important to your trading; it’s  \\ncritical that you understand them.\\nIn uptrends, every time the price drops to the uptrend line and then re -\\nsumes its advance, the trendline has acted as support to the price uptrend.  \\nSupport can also be found at prices of previous support or resistance.\\nIn downtrends, every time the price rises to the downtrend line and then  \\nresumes its decline, the downtrend line has acted as resistance to the up -\\nward move of market prices.\\nConsider the following: when price action drops to a certain level, the  \\nbulls (the buyers) take control and prevent prices from falling lower.  \\nSimilar to support, a resistance level is the point at which bears (the sell -\\ners) take control of prices and prevent them from rising higher.\\n121'),\n",

On the same bar that broke the downtrend, prices went to the re -\\nsistance level at 1464.00 and retraced. 10 minutes later, they went 2 ticks  \\nabove the resistance level, but closed AT the resistance level.\\nFor the next 2 hours and 30 minutes, prices never go above the resistance  \\nlevel of 1464, but they repeatedly test this level, eventually breaking out.\\n122'),\n",

Moving averages tell the aver -\\nage price in a given point of time over a defined period of time, typically  \\nthe closing price. They’re called ‘moving’ because they reflect the latest  \\naverage, while adhering to the same time measure.\\nA weakness of moving averages is that they lag the market, so they do  \\nnot necessarily signal a change in trends. To address this issue, use a  \\nshorter period, such as a 5- or 10-day moving average, which will be  \\nmore reflective of the recent price action than the 40- or 200-day moving  \\naverages. The concept is simple:\\n\\ue12c A buy  signal  is generated  when  the  closing  price  moves  \\nabove the moving average.\\n\\ue12c A sell signal is generated when the closing price dips below  \\nthe moving average.\\nHere’s an example using the 10-minute chart of Amazon (AMZN):\\n129'),\n",

This computation tells us where, within the next day range, to -\\nday's close is located. If it’s high in the range it will be in the high per -\\ncentiles, say over 80%. If we’re closing low in the range of the last ‘X’ \\nnumber of days, it would be in the 20% or lower area.\\nThe index has many uses, but the simplest one is just allowing it to iden -\\ntify or suggest an overbought, oversold zone.\\nThe index can be used in all markets and in all timeframes. Most traders  \\nuse it successfully on intraday bar charts with a parameter of 14 bars.\\nAs stated above, the indicator shows the relationship of the closing price  \\nto a high-low range over a specific period of time, typically 14 bars.\\nThe result is plotted on a chart and oscillates between 0 and 100. The  \\nbasic idea is that if prices are trading at the high of the high-low range  \\n(indicator reading close to 100), then the market is overbought, and if the  \\ncurrent prices are trading close to the low of the specified range (indica -\\ntor reading close to 0), then the market is oversold.\\n\\ue12c A sell  signal  is  generated  when  the  indicator  has  a  value\\nabove 80.\\n\\ue12c A buy  signal  is  generated  when  the  indicator  has  a  value\\nbelow 20.\\n135\"),\n",

A good trader will  \\nknow when to take a small loss and go on to the next trade.\\nI can’t stress this enough: even the most experienced traders have a stop  \\nloss order in the market, whether they’re trading forex, futures, options,  \\nor even stocks.\\nRemember that your trading capital is your business – if you burn it,  \\nthere’s no insurance. You’re done. Once you’ve entered a trade, immedi -\\nately place a stop. This safeguards you from losing your entire account.\\n143\"),\n",

I mention this because I happen to know a trader who is very disci -\\nplined, who always enters a stop loss and a profit target order once he has  \\nestablished a trade. A few years back, this trader suffered a number of  \\nlosses over the course of several days. So, naturally, he was quite happy  \\nto see that a trade finally moved in his direction.\\nAccording to his strategy, his stop losses were very small and his profit  \\ntarget was rather large, so if this trade reached the profit target, he would  \\nmake up for all the losses of the past couple of days PLUS bring in a  \\nsmall profit on top of it.\\nAnd it happened: the market continued to move in his favor and he real -\\nized a profit.\\nHe was so happy that he jumped up from his chair, ran into the kitchen,  \\nand told his wife all about the fantastic trade. FINALLY he had made  \\nsome  money.  They  enjoyed  a  happy  cup  of  coffee  together,  and  he  \\ncouldn’t stop talking about his strategy, the trade, and how it paid off.\\nAnd when he returned to his computer an hour later, he found himself in  \\na losing position.\\nHe couldn’t believe it! How had this happened?\\nAfter a few minutes, it dawned on him: he had forgotten to cancel his  \\nstop loss. While he was celebrating his win, the market retraced and  \\nfilled his order, and then continued to go up.\\nThe stop loss order was a sell order, and now the trader had a short posi -\\ntion in a rising market. All of his profits were gone.\\nThe moral of the story:\\nMake SURE to cancel your orders, or use so-called “bracket orders,” or  \\n“one-cancel-other (OCO) orders” for your profit target and stop loss.  \\nYour broker can explain these terms to you in detail.\\n144\"),\n",

Just specify a dollar amount that you’re willing to  \\nrisk, subtract it from your entry price, and place a stop loss order.\\nHow to Use This Strategy:\\nSimply subtract the dollar amount you specified from your entry price.\\nExample:\\nLet’s say you’re trading the EUR/USD currency pair. You entered the  \\nmarket at 1.4585 and you want to risk $100. Since 1 pip (= 0.0001)  \\nequals $10, you place your stop loss at 10 pips (= 0.0010) below your  \\nentry price at 1.4575.\\n145'),\n",

If  \\nyou’re short a security, you’ll buy it in order to close the position.

Many traders use post-its after they’ve entered a trade: you  \\nstick a ‘SELL’ post-it on your screen if you went long, and a ‘BUY’ post-\\nit if you went short. This way, you ensure that you’ll ALWAYS exit the  \\nposition as planned.\\nWhen to Use This Strategy:\\nThis strategy is perfect for beginners, since you don’t have to perform  \\ncomplex calculations. You simply add or subtract your stop loss to or  \\nfrom your entry price and that’s it.

In  Monte  Carlo  \\nsimulations, the basic idea is to take a sequence of trades gener -\\nated by a trading system, randomize the order of trades, and cal -\\nculate the rate of return and the maximum drawdown, assuming  \\nthat x% of the account is risked on each trade.\\nThe process is repeated several hundred times, each time using a  \\ndifferent random sequence of the same trades.

In 2000, the average daily  \\nrange was 100-150 ticks per day; in 2004, it was only 40-60 ticks per  \\nday.\\nIf you back-test any trend-following day trading system in the E-mini  \\nS&P, you’ll see that it worked perfectly until 2002, and then, suddenly, it  \\nfell apart. It seems that there were no more intraday trends. That's not  \\nsurprising as the daily range of the E-mini S&P decreased by more than  \\n50%.\\nWhat happened?\\nThere are a couple of plausible explanations. Probably the best and most  \\nimportant one is the introduction of the Pattern Day Trading Rule in Au -\\ngust and September of 2001, by the NYSE and NASD. If a trader exe -\\ncutes four or more day trades within a five-business-day period then he  \\nmust maintain a minimum equity of $25,000 in his margin account at all  \\ntimes. Because  of this rule, traders stopped  day trading equities and  \\nstarted trading the E-mini S&P futures instead.\\nLook at this graph showing the sudden increase in volume in the E-mini  \\nS&P in the beginning of 2001.\\nMany of these stock day traders used methods to scalp the market for a  \\nfew pennies. Using the E-mini S&P, they suddenly had a much higher  \\nleverage and paid fewer commissions, and their methods were extremely  \\nprofitable.\\nUnfortunately, these scalping methods kill an intraday trend almost in -\\nstantly, making almost every trend-following approach fail.\\nAnother reason for the dramatic change of the market was the introduc -\\ntion of the automated strategy execution in TradeStation. In 2002, the  \\nTradeStation customers who were using this feature increased by 268%.  \\nOverbought/oversold strategies became very popular, and when the mar -\\nket made an attempt to trend, these strategies immediately established a  \\ncontrary position.\\n165\"),\n",

If you want to buy  \\nsomething (e.g. a certain stock or futures contract), then somebody else  \\nneeds to sell it to you. And, you can only sell a position if somebody else  \\nis willing to buy from you at the price you\\'re asking.\\nThis means that if you lose money on a trade, then the person who took  \\nthe other side of the trade is MAKING money. And vice versa: if you’re  \\nmaking money on a trade, then the other trader is losing money. In the  \\nmarkets, money is not \"generated.\" It just changes hands.\\nSo, if you’re going long at a certain price level, and you lose, then try to  \\ngo short instead. Many times this is the easiest way to turn a losing sys -\\ntem into a winning one.\\nAverage Profit per Trade\\nThe next figure you want to look at is the average profit per trade. Make  \\nsure this number is greater than slippage and commissions, and that it  \\nmakes your trading worthwhile. Trading is all about risk and reward, and  \\nyou want to make sure you get a decent reward for your risk.\\nWinning Percentage\\nMany profitable trading systems achieve a nice net profit with a rather  \\nsmall winning percentage, sometimes even below 30%. These systems  \\nfollow the principle: “Cut your losses short and let your profits run.”  \\nHowever, YOU need to decide whether you can stand 7 losers and only 3  \\nwinners in 10 trades. If you want to be “right” most of the time, then you  \\nshould pick a system with a high winning percentage.\\nUnderstanding Winning Percentage\\nLet\\'s say you purchased or developed a system that has a winning per -\\ncentage of 70%.\\nWhat exactly does that mean?\\n168'),\n",

But it doesn’t guarantee that after 3  \\nlosers in a row, you’ll have a winner.\\nExample:\\nIf you toss a coin then you have 2 possible outcomes: heads or tails. The  \\nprobability for each is 50% – i.e. when you toss the coin 4 times, then  \\nyou should get 2 heads and 2 tails.\\nBut what if you tossed the coin 3 times and you got heads 3 times?\\nWhat is the probability of heads on the fourth coin toss?\\n50%, or less?\\nIf you answered 'less,' than you fell for a common misconception. The  \\nprobability of getting heads again is still 50%. No more and no less.\\nBut many traders think that the probability of tails is higher now because  \\nthe three previous coin tosses resulted in heads. Some traders might even  \\nincrease their bet because they are convinced that now “tails is overdue.”  \\nStatistically, this assumption is nonsense; it’s a dangerous – and many  \\ntimes costly – misconception.\\nLet's get back to our trading example: if you have a winning percentage  \\nof 70%, and you had 9 losers in a row, what’s the probability of having a  \\nwinner now? It's still 70% (and therefore there's still a 30% chance of a  \\nloser).\\n169\"),\n",

Your drawdown would be 20%.\\nNow, let's say you make more trades and gain $4,000, which brings you  \\nto $12,000 ($8,000 + $4,000 = $12,000). And after this, on the next  \\ntrade, you  lose  $2,000. Your  drawdown would  be 16.7% ($12,000  -  \\n$2,000). The $12,000 was your equity peak; that was the highest point in  \\nthe period we looked at.\\nIf you started your account with $10,000 and the lowest amount you had  \\nin your account over a six-month period was $5,000, then you had a 50%  \\ndrawdown.\\n170\"),\n",

Even though you lost 50% from your high of $10,000, you  \\nwould need to make 100% on the $5,000 to get back to your original  \\namount.\\nMeasuring Drawdown Recovery:\\nDrawdown recovery can confuse many traders. If a trader loses 20% of  \\nhis account, he thinks he needs to make 20% in order to get back to even.\\nThis isn’t true. If you started with $10,000 and lost $2,000 (20%), you  \\nwould need to make 25% in order to get back to even. The difference  \\nbetween $8,000 and $10,000 is $2,000. If you calculate the $2,000 as a  \\npercentage of $8,000 (not the original $10,000) it works out to 25%.\\nA famous trader once said: “If you want your system to double or triple  \\nyour account, you should expect a drawdown of up to 30% on your way  \\nto trading riches.” Not every trader can stand a 30% drawdown.\\nLook at the maximum drawdown that your strategy has produced so far,  \\nand double it. If you can stand this drawdown, then you’ve found the  \\nright strategy.\\nWhy double it? Remember: your worst drawdown is always ahead of  \\nyou. It’s best to plan for it now.\\nConclusion\\nThe above examples provide you with some guidelines, but it’s up to you  \\nto decide whether the numbers in the strategy’s performance report work  \\nfor you or don’t.\\nUltimately, YOU’RE the one trading the strategy, and YOU’RE the one  \\nwho has to feel comfortable with the expected results of your strategy.\\n171'),\n",

The same applies to trading: you  \\ncan make a lot of money if you’re risking a lot, but if you do, the risk of  \\nruin is also high. You need to find a healthy balance between risk and  \\nreward.\\nMake sure your trading strategy is using small stop losses and that your  \\nprofit targets are bigger than your stop losses.\\nStay away from strategies that have a small profit target of only $100 and  \\na stop loss of $2,000. Sure, the winning percentage will be fantastic, but  \\n2-3 losses in a row can wipe out your trading account.\\nThe perfect balance between risk and reward is 1:1.5 or more – i.e. for  \\nevery dollar you risk you should be able to make at least $1.50.\\nIn other words, if you apply a stop loss of $100, your profit target should  \\nbe at least $150.\\n184'),\n",

A  \\ngood trading system allows you to start with one or two contracts, in -\\ncreasing your position as your trading account grows.\\nThis is in contrast to many \"martingale\" trading systems, which require  \\nincreasing position sizes when you are in a losing streak.\\nYou’ve probably heard about this strategy: double your contracts every  \\ntime you lose, and one winner will win back all the money you previ -\\nously lost.\\n185'),\n",

The an -\\nswer: very likely. That was the entire point of the previous few pages.  \\nJust think back to the example with the coins: an atypical negative trad -\\ning run CAN and WILL happen.\\nThis is why I do not recommend doubling up after each loss. If we trade  \\nin a disciplined, systematic manner, then when our atypical run DOES  \\noccur, we will still be in the game at the end of it.\\nRegardless of the strategy or method you use to trade, there will be occa -\\nsions when you have losses, or even a string of losses. When these occur,  \\nit’s important to have faith in your trading plan; don’t try to double up  \\nyour trades to “catch up” on your wins.\\nThe main point I want to make here is that every trading system you find  \\nwill go through times when it has more losses than wins.\\nThis  is  to  be  expected, and  it’s where  effective  money  management  \\ncomes into play.\\nPrinciple #7: Automate Your Exits\\nEmotions and human errors are the most common mistakes that traders  \\nmake. You have to avoid these mistakes by any means necessary, espe -\\ncially when the market starts to move fast. You might experience panic  \\nand indecision, but if you give in to those emotions, you’ll suffer a much  \\ngreater loss than you had originally planned for.\\nYour exit points should be easy to determine. The best solution for your  \\nexit points is the use of “bracket orders.” Most trading platforms offer  \\nbracket orders, which allow you to attach a profit target and a stop loss to  \\nyour entry.\\nThis way, you can put your trade on autopilot, and the trading system  \\nwill close your position at the specified levels.\\nOf course, this assumes that you have easy exit rules. A stop loss of  \\n$100, or 1%, of the entry price can easily be specified in today’s trading  \\nplatforms.\\n187'),\n",

Think about driv -\\ning a car: if you can’t drive a Ford, you definitely won’t be able to drive  \\na Ferrari.\\nPrinciple #8: Have a High Percentage of Winning Trades\\nYour trading strategy should produce more winners than 50%. There\\'s no  \\ndoubt that trading strategies with smaller winning percentages can be  \\nprofitable, too, but the psychological pressure is enormous.\\nTaking 7 losers out of 10 trades, and not doubting that system, takes a  \\ngreat deal of discipline, and many traders can\\'t stand the pressure. After  \\nthe sixth loser, they’ll start \"improving\" the strategy, or stop trading it  \\ncompletely.\\nIt’s very helpful for beginning or novice traders to gain confidence in  \\ntheir trading, and if your strategy gives you a high winning percentage,  \\nlet’s say more than 65%, your confidence will definitely be on the rise.\\nPrinciple #9: Test Your Strategy on at Least 200 Trades\\nThe more trades you use in your back-testing (without curve-fitting), the  \\nhigher the probability that your trading strategy will succeed in the fu -\\nture. Look at the following table:\\nNumber of Trades 50 100 200 300 500\\n<>Margin of Error 14% 10% 7% 6% 4%\\nThe more trades you have in your back-testing, the smaller the margin of  \\nerror, and the higher the probability of producing profits in the future.\\n188'),\n",

Keep in mind that indicators are based  \\non five variables: the open, the high, the low, the close, and the volume  \\nof a certain timeframe.\\nIndicators are simply collecting this data and displaying it differently,  \\nand they do this by setting certain variables up in relation to others, or in  \\nrelation to previous data.\\n200'),\n",

There are many! Here’s just a  \\nfew:\\n\\ue12c Greed – “I’m sure the market will continue rising, and I’ll make  \\nmillions!”\\n\\ue12c Fear – “Please… . I don’t want to experience another loss.”\\n\\ue12c Panic – “Oh no, the market is moving fast. Why? What should I  \\ndo? The sky is falling… !”\\n\\ue12c Indecision – “Should I enter this trade? Or should I wait? Ok,  \\nnow I’m in a trade: should I take profits? Or not yet? Hmm, the  \\ntrade goes against me: should I get out now, or should I give it a  \\nlittle bit more room?”\\n\\ue12c Excitement (hopefully!) – “Hey, I made money!”\\nHow many negative emotions are on this list? Too many!\\nIn order to become a successful trader, you have to have control over  \\nyour emotions. The best strategies and tools are useless if you lose your  \\nhead while you’re in a trade.\\nThe Best Tools Are Useless\\nI  recently  saw  the  movie  “The  Guardian,” with  Kevin  Costner  and  \\nAshton Kutcher. It’s about the U.S. Coast Guard. Kevin Costner plays an  \\ninstructor who trains young recruits to become rescue swimmers.\\nOne day, they have a simple exercise in the pool: one of the instructors  \\nsimulates a victim and one of the cadets has to rescue him. When the res -\\ncue  swimmer  approaches  the  drowning  victim,  the  victim  grabs  the  \\nswimmer and holds him tight, trying not to drown.\\n205'),\n",

And both  \\nof them almost drown.\\nAfter the exercise, Kevin Costner’s character explains this to the cadets;  \\nthe only difference between THEM and the drowning victim out there in  \\nthe ocean is that THEY have a strategy to rescue the victim and deal with  \\nthe situation. But all of the tools and equipment that they have are abso -\\nlutely useless if they panic, or have no idea what to do.\\nThey need to remain calm and execute their strategy.\\nThe same is true in trading: you can have the best trading strategy, supe -\\nrior software, the fastest computer, several 21” monitors, a $1,500 ergo -\\nnomic chair, and an office with the most stunning view, but all of these  \\nthings are absolutely useless if you’re in a trade and you panic.\\nRemain calm, cool, and relaxed. Control your emotions – don’t let them  \\ncontrol you.\\nMistake #7: Overtrading\\nMany traders think that “quantity” is better than “quality.” They believe  \\nthat if you just throw enough punches, one will eventually hit. They trade  \\nlike maniacs and make their broker rich.\\nTraders are overtrading for the following three reasons, and none of them  \\nare good:\\n1.)  Greed\\nYou just closed a winning trade. You followed your plan and  \\nmade the profits that you were looking for. But the market keeps  \\ngoing up. You think, “I should have stayed in this trade,” so you  \\njump right back in.

Choose a Trading Time\\nBefore entering the online trading market, be sure to choose a  \\nblock of time that suits your lifestyle. There is no point in trying  \\nto trade if you can’t find a suitable time to do it.\\nEveryone has commitments in their lives which cannot be ig -\\nnored, so you have to decide for yourself which regularly sched -\\nuled block of time you are most comfortable with.\\n3.) Develop a Strategy For Your Day Trading\\nEvery online day trader should have an online trading strategy  \\nwhich he follows religiously.

It’s important to determine  \\nyour strategy before you begin to trade.\\n4.) Trade the Right Market\\nDifferent markets have different trading profiles, which vary in  \\nvolatility  (the  online  currency  market  is  considered  the  most  \\nvolatile of them all). Some are ideal for intraday trading while  \\nothers are favorable for long-term action.\\nDetermine the market you want to invest in based on factors  \\nsuch as your account size, trading timeframe, personal knowl-\\nedge, and risk tolerance.\\n5.) Be Open to Learning\\nIf you’re a first-time day trader in the market, there are a number  \\nof risk-free ways for you to gain experience.

Re -\\nmember, if you trade big, you’re risking big money and setting  \\nyourself up for big failure.\\nAlso, consider a few of these effective day trading strategies to stick to:\\n\\ue12c Believe in the day trading system you follow.  Do not question \\nthe effectiveness of its rules and methods unless, and until, you  \\nhave successfully explored all of its trading options.\\n\\ue12c Trade only twice a day – once in the morning and once in the  \\nafternoon. Continue trading this way for at least the first 2 to 3  \\nmonths. A conservative schedule will save you from the tempta -\\ntion of overtrading.\\n\\ue12c Make a  weekly  goal  of $250  or $300  profit  per contract. \\nWhen you get a successful trade and achieve the weekly target of  \\n$250 or more, you should switch off your trading screen and take  \\na break until the following Monday. This will be good for your  \\nhealth – and it’ll also help prevent overtrading.

Of course, it always  \\nhelps to have a little risk-free practice first, right?\\nAfter all, you might still be pretty new to trading, even after having read  \\nthis book and completing the action items. You don't want to lose thou -\\nsands of dollars because you made a small mistake in your trading plan,  \\ndo you?\\nBut how can you get started without risking a single penny of your own  \\nmoney?\\n221\"),\n",

Or, just contact Rockwell Trading® , and we’ll  \\nget you set up with a free paper trading account our selves.\\nSo what is a paper trading account?\\nA paper  trading  account  let\\'s  you  trade  your  strategy  with  \"virtual  \\nmoney.\" You will get live quotes, and you can enter the trades according  \\nto your plan. The system will simulate fills, and you\\'ll find yourself in a  \\ntrading position. Paper trading accounts show the profit and loss in real-\\ntime, and you can see LIVE how much money you are making or losing.  \\nKeep in mind that we\\'re talking about \"virtual money,\" so you are not  \\nactually making money yet.\\nIf you’re serious about your trading success, you MUST trade your strat -\\negy on a paper trading account first.\\nHere’s why:\\nThe biggest enemy of a trader is discipline. Traders lose money because  \\nof a lack of discipline. Your trading plan might be excellent, but if you  \\ndon\\'t have the discipline to follow it, then you\\'re doomed. Trading your  \\nstrategy on a paper trading account will help you to gain confidence in  \\nyour strategy AND develop the much-needed discipline to actually make  \\nmoney with it.\\nAn Example for Trading the E-mini S&P:\\nYour system establishes a long position at 1190.00, and the profit target  \\norder was placed at 1192.25 ($112.50 profit per contract). Prices move  \\nup to 1192.00 and then reverse. One hour later, the system tries to re verse \\nat 1191.00. Again, prices move up to 1190.75 and reverse. Two times,  \\nthe system missed the profit target by one tick.\\nShould you change the strategy?\\n222'),\n",

Let\\'s say you start by  \\nlowering your profit goal one tick. Of course, you would be instantly re -\\nwarded, because the number of winners would increase.\\nNext week, though, you might experience the following situation: your  \\nstop is hit and you are taken out of the trade, but then the market turns  \\nand takes off and you are missing a nice winner. What now? Well, you  \\nstart moving your stop a little bit further away, and again, you’re in -\\nstantly rewarded: the number of losses decrease.\\nOne week later, you experience a similar situation and you continue  \\n\"fine-tuning\" your system by slightly moving down your profit goal and  \\nminimally increasing your stop loss. And very soon, the winning system  \\nthat you once had turns into a losing one, because your losses are much  \\nbigger than your profits.\\nI’ve seen it so many times: a trader will back-test his system with over  \\n700 or maybe even 1,000 trades, and then he \"fine-tunes\" it after the first  \\n5 trades. This doesn\\'t make sense! If you have a sound logic to why your  \\nsystem should work, then you shouldn’t \"fine-tune\" it after just 5 trades.  \\nIt doesn’t NEED fine-tuning.\\nYou should evaluate your system periodically, but instead of curve-fitting  \\nyour system\\'s parameters, you should ask yourself: \"Does the logic of the  \\nsystem still apply?\"\\nIf you have a trend-following strategy and markets are trading sideways,  \\nthen  \"optimizing\"  the  strategy  parameters  won\\'t  even  help  – it\\'s  the  \\nwrong market condition, and the market is just not right for your strat egy.\\nSo, again, exercise discipline: if your strategy worked well for over 1,000  \\ntrades, and you have sound logic, and you haven\\'t curve-fitted the strat -\\negy, then you should not override the plan or \"fine-tune\" it after only a  \\nfew trades!\\n223'),\n",

You're  getting  something  special.  Our  \\npersonalized coaching is what sets us apart from our competitors.\\nIt doesn't matter how skilled, or unskilled, of a trader you are - a coach is  \\nessential to your success. Think about it. All of the best professionals out  \\nthere have coaches, regardless of their innate talents.\\nLook at Tiger Woods. He's a phenomenal golfer, a real natural. But he's  \\nstill got a coach. And do you remember what happened to Tiger Woods  \\nwhen he fired his coaches? It wasn't pretty.
